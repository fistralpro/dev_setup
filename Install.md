_This needs splitting into some scripts that include a git clone  
we need to check for items required for installation and then install  
it.  
We need to create an alias to run the dockerd (if not already running)  
Then we need to create a selection of curated docker containers for use  
as part of a standardised environment.  Resources should include:  
  TOMCAT  
  NGINX  
  DATABASE/s  
  RABBITMQ  
With interconnects between them and a local drive shared across windows-wsl2 and the  
container.
We also need to have the GIT credentials available to wsl2 for cloning  
Dev setup between Mac, Windows and Linux will differ -> but the docker-compose  
environments should just work._  


## Activate wsl2  
_From command prompt_  
```
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart  
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart  
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

_now_  
  1.  install ubuntu from the store  
  2.  open the ubuntu app  
  3.  set username and password  (e.g. fistralpro fistralpro)  
  4.  close the ubuntu app  

_from command prompt_  
`wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2`  




## Install Docker & Docker-compose on Ubuntu  
**We won't use the convenience script from get.docker.com so we can understand what is going on.**  
_Refresh and install packages_  
```
sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release  
```
**What am I installing?**  
https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/ca-certificates: Contains the certificate authorities shipped with Mozilla's browser to allow SSL-based applications to check for the authenticity of SSL connections.  
https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/curl: A command line tool for transferring data with URL syntax, supporting DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP.  
https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/GnuPG:  GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage. It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures. It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC4880.  
https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/lsb-release:  A simple tool to help identify the Linux distribution being used and its compliance with the Linux Standard Base. LSB conformance will not be reported unless the required metapackages are installed.  

_Add Docker official Key and setup repository_  
```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

_Install docker_  
`sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin`  


_Add user group_  
```
sudo groupadd docker  
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}  
```

_Install versioned docker-compose_  
`sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.1.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`

_We need to run dockerd detached from the controlling terminal_  
`sudo dockerd </dev/null &>/dev/null &`  
OR we can have it autostart by adding it to our profile:  
`vi ~/.profile`  
Adding the following to the end of the file:  
```
if service docker status 2>&1 | grep -q "is not running"; then
    wsl.exe -d "${WSL_DISTRO_NAME}" -u root -e /usr/sbin/service docker start >/dev/null 2>&1
fi
```
For changes to take effect you'll have to close and reopen your shell

## Run any docker container  
_ClichÃ© example_  
`sudo docker run hello-world`

## share windows SSL config  
You can setup ssl in linux, or just copy your existing windows setup over.   Ubuntu comes with ssh pre-installed  
```
cp -r /mnt/c/Users/fistr/.ssh ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

## share git config  
You can setup git in linux, or just copy your existing windows setup over.  Ubuntu comes with git pre-installed     
```
cp -r /mnt/c/Users/fistr/.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig 
chmod 600 ~/.gitconfig
```


## Working practice    
What I want to be able to do is run intellij from within wsl2: unfortunately if you have a high res display it looks rubbish :-(
The following is a nice way of sharing your home folder - it is by no means necessary
Recommended working practice is to work from wsl2 while linking to your %userprofile% in the windows subsystem.  
Windows home is mounted in /mnt/c/{username}.  
Mine is /mnt/c/Users/fistr  
Recommended practice is to create a workspace folder in windows and add an alias to that folder  
`echo 'alias workspace="cd /mnt/c/Users/fistr/workspace"' >> ~/.bash_aliases`  
then reload bash  
'exec bash -l'
(this assumes the standard .bashrc is still there -> if not copy it from `/etc/skel`  

# Optional
## Install IntelliJ in wsl2 
The biggest issue we have is that the display will look awful if you have a high dpi advice -> also window management is bad... but it appears to be the fault of linux: even if you install the vGPU driver listed below
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps
You can create a .wslgconfig in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\WSL\ to see what it looks like
```
[system-distro-env]
WESTON_RDP_DISABLE_FRACTIONAL_HI_DPI_SCALING=false
WESTON_RDP_DEBUG_DESKTOP_SCALING_FACTOR=150
```

If you do wish intellij...
_need to install chrome first to approve licence - sigh_
```
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo apt install --fix-broken -y
sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

google-chrome >/dev/null 2>&1 &

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mmk2410/intellij-idea -y
sudo apt install intellij-idea-ultimate -y
```
